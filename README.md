# Neon Tic TacToe
Cool Neon Tic Tac Toe made using the MVP(Model View Presenter) pattern to prove that separating the model from the view is actually useful
## Please be aware
This is just a proof of concept! In some parts I was lazy enough to do a nice and clean solution and went with an ugly one instead.
I made this project for myself to understand pros and cons of the MVP pattern in Unity
And actually it's pretty nice. Of cource it will take 10 times more time to make it, but in the end it can be worth it(especially if your project is big)
And the most important thing that I want to tell is: DONT OVERENGINEER STUFF.
