# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe using MVP to prove that separating model from view is actually useful
## Please be aware
This is just a proof of concept! In some parts I was lazy enough to do nice and clean solution and went with an ugly one instead.
I made this project for myself, so I would understand pros and cons of MVP pattern in Unity
And actually it's pretty nice. Of cource making MVP requires like 10 times more work, but in the end it can be worth it(especially if your project is big)
